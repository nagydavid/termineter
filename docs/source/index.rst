Termineter Documentation
========================

Termineter is a framework written in python to provide a platform for the
security testing of smart meters. It implements the C12.18 and C12.19 protocols
for communication. Currently supported are Meters using C12.19 with 7-bit
character sets. Termineter communicates with Smart Meters via a connection using
an ANSI type-2 optical probe with a serial interface. The source code is
available on the `GitHub homepage`_.
